Free bilingual texts

This project aims to create a Django base web application with a wide range of free bilingual texts shown on a split screen.

I believe that the best way to learn languages is to read a lot. This comes after the initial period of getting used to the language. When you are ready to dive in into more advanced texts, it is great to read a lot of bilingual books and texts, to move to the next level, of reading only in the target language.

There a lot of great literature with translations on the internet, but there is no easy way of reading them on a split screen. This application aims to change that.

If you are interested in joining in on the effort, you are welcome.
